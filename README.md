# pCloud2 - cloud file storage

pCloud2 - The application is designed for deployment on a home server, cloud file storage

This application is designed for deploying home cloud storage.
It consists of a server and client part. This application does not store
information about files in a database, but works with the file system directly,
which allows you to add files to the storage not only using the client,
but in any way convenient for you, for example, through the Samba protocol.
The application allows you to share links with the ability to set the lifetime
of the link and set a PIN code to access the data.

DOCUMENTATION IN PROGRESS!!!
